1) 39 lines per frame
2) the first 10 is what the variable is set as when the code starts running. the code will continue running up until x is less than 10 than the width of the canvas (390), and the third part adds 10 to x in every frame.


(practice with arrays questions)
1) 6 times
2) 3) in " for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i = i + 20)" we can change the '10' in 'i+ 10' to a lower number to make the trail longer. 
3) I made the trail longer by lessening the 'i' inside the for loop
